# Steam Manifest Patcher

This is a short application which patches Steam so that you use depot_download again after it was disabled by Valve.

The code is based on [SteamManifestFixer](https://github.com/ioncodes/SteamManifestFixer) by ioncodes.

I rewrote this in Zig due to dissatisfaction with the error handling in the original C++.
